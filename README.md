A color picker app implemented using React.

I'd like to come back and adjust the following issues:
* make responsive --> vertical layout on phone
* make background gradient fill full screen better
* make menu arrow flip when menu is down
* animate the dropdown menu better
* Capitalize active color mode
* simplify code for menu items (perhaps array and map?)
